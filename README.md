Welcome to the 60's

Waiting on the next video/lesson. This shit is the best.

Still waiting brah!

Talk to you tonight. Remember this, no matter what, ammo is more important than guns. You can have a thousand friends with AK-47's and they might as well be invisible compared to the one guy with a .22 small hunting rifle and 10k rounds. Buy 9mm full metal jackets and .223 rounds. Those are what are already sought after and will be hoarded immediately when the shit goes down.
